                    <p class="story-paragraph"><span class="story-location">Christ University, Bangalore.</span><br>
                    <span class="story-date">August 2017.</span></p>
                    
                    <p class="story-paragraph">The day had ended like any other—classes done, the sun dipping low, hostel gates waiting. As he walked back after college hours, lost in his usual thoughts, something made him pause. Near the college bus stop stood a girl, quietly waiting for the bus that would take her home.</p>
                    
                    <p class="story-paragraph">He didn't even know why his heart suddenly skipped a beat. But just like people say—sometimes love really does begin at first sight.</p>
                    
                    <p class="story-paragraph">Before he could gather the courage to say a word, she stepped onto the bus. And she disappeared from his sight—but not from his mind.</p>
                    
                    <p class="story-paragraph">That night, sleep didn't come easily.<br>
                    Who was she? What was her name?</p>
                    
                    <p class="story-paragraph">Two days later, fate answered.</p>
                    
                    <p class="story-paragraph">He spotted her again. Determined not to let the moment slip away twice, he joined a student community she was part of, just to find a reason to talk to her. A conversation began. Then another. Slowly, effortlessly, they became friends.</p>
                    
                    <p class="story-paragraph">Friendship turned into comfort. And before they realized it, they were best friends.</p>
                    
                    <p class="story-paragraph">Two years passed in laughter, shared secrets, and countless memories. One day, he gathered all his courage and told her the truth—he loved her.</p>
                    
                    <p class="story-paragraph">Her answer was gentle, but firm. "No."</p>
                    
                    <p class="story-paragraph">She wanted him in her life—but as a good friend.</p>
                    
                    <p class="story-paragraph">It hurt, but he stayed. Because some love doesn't walk away.</p>
                    
                    <p class="story-paragraph">They continued as they always had—going out for fun, skipping classes for masala chai, laughing endlessly. He taught her how to ride a bike, steadying her every time she lost balance, never letting her fall. Life felt light when they were together.</p>
                    
                    <p class="story-paragraph">Then came 2020. The world stopped. COVID arrived. Campuses closed. And they returned to their homes, miles apart.</p>
                    
                    <p class="story-paragraph">In the silence of lockdown, something changed.</p>
                    
                    <p class="story-paragraph">She began to miss him—his voice, his presence, the comfort of simply talking to him. Conversations turned frequent. Messages became longer. Days felt incomplete without hearing from him.</p>
                    
                    <p class="story-paragraph">And then, not long after, she flew to the states with her family. Distance grew, but his feelings never faded.</p>
                    
                    <p class="story-paragraph">After that first glance in Bangalore, in 2021, she finally said the words he had once whispered with hope: "I'm in love with you too."</p>
                    
                    <p class="story-paragraph">Wanting to be closer to her—not just in heart but in reality—he made a brave decision. He moved all the way to U.S</p>
                    
                    <p class="story-paragraph">That moment erased every doubt, every waiting year, every unanswered question.</p>
                    
                    <p class="story-paragraph">They didn't just begin a relationship—they began a chapter written with patience, friendship, distance, and destiny.</p>
                    
                    <p class="story-paragraph story-ending">What started as a silent glance at a bus stop became a love story that crossed years, countries, and hearts—proving that some love stories are not rushed…<br>
                    They arrive exactly when they are meant to. ❤️</p>
